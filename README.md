**Recommended Testnet: Sepolia**

**Graph-nft-marketplace:** Index blockchain network transaction data through the graph, establish a data structure for NFT Marketplace, and facilitate query of transaction dataã€‚

**Hardhat-DAO-template:** Build a decentralized DAO dapp by using the openzeppelin contract. Users can initiate proposals, vote, and execute them automatically through time-lock contracts.

**Hardhat-NFT-marketplace:** Build a decentralized NFT trading market through smart contracts, allowing sellers to list NFTs, modify prices, and remove them from the shelves. Provide users with NFT purchasing services. Similar to Opensea.

**Hardhat-NFT:** Use Chainlink vrf and Chainlink data feeds to provide players with randomly generated NFTs, as well as SVG NFTs.

**Hardhat-aave:** By calling aave pool through javascript, users can deposit ETH tokens, lend DAI tokens, and return DAI tokens.

**Hardhat-lottery:** Use Chainlink automation to automatically execute chainlink vrf v2 to apply for random numbers, and allow users to pay admission fees to join the lottery game. By modulating the random number, the entire entry fee in the contract is sent to the winner.

**Hardhat-upgrades:** Contract upgrades through agency contracts and execution contracts. The agent contract is responsible for storing new data and executing the contract to run the called function logic.
